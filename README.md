<p>The main idea was to understand how class inheritance works. Utilize an already build shape class and build two seperate classes that build off the parent class and obtain its methods. I learned how class inheritance works and got great practice creating the Triangle and Rectangle classes. Practicing using the super method to inherit the Shape class methods and passing the arguments showed me how useful and time saving inheritance can be when writing a program.</p>
